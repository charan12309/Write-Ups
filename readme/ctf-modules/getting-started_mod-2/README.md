## Foundations

### Shell

The shell takes user input and passes commands to the operating system to perform a specific function.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Port

Ports are virtual points where network connections begin and end.

They allow a computer to route different types of traffic simultaneously over a single network connection by mapping specific data streams to distinct software processes (e.g., SSH vs. web requests).

{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/protocol-comparison-tcp-vs....md" %}

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Web server

Software running on a host machine that directly handles HTTP/HTTPS traffic from a client browser over TCP ports 80 and 443.

It processes incoming requests, maps them to physical files, or hands them off to the application backend. This creates a large attack surface.

Attack surface breakdown:

## Access and terminal tools

### Using SSH

Secure Shell is a network protocol that runs on port 22 by default and provides users a secure way to access a computer remotely.

SSH can use password authentication or public-key authentication with a public and private key pair.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Using Netcat

Netcat, `ncat`, or `nc` is used to interact with TCP and UDP ports.

It can be used for many things during a pentest.

Its primary use is connecting to shells.

Netcat can connect to any listening port and interact with the service on that port.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Netcat can also be used to grab a banner from a target IP and port.

This is called banner grabbing.

Netcat can also be used to transfer files.

```bash
nc -nv <TARGET_IP> <TARGET_PORT>
```

Then there is also Socat, often called Netcat on steroids. A [standalone binary](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries) of `Socat` can be transferred to a system after remote code execution to get a more stable reverse shell.

Socat also supports forwarding ports and connecting to serial devices.

1. **Port forwarding**

When you hack a target network, you often find a central server (like a database) that is completely hidden from the internet behind a firewall.

You cannot talk to it directly.

But if you have already compromised the public web server sitting right next to it, you can tell that web server: _"Take any traffic I send to you on port X, and automatically forward it to the hidden database on port Y."_

2. **Connecting to serial devices**

* **Serial devices**: Physical hardware components like routers, IoT devices, or microchips that transmit data sequentially, one bit at a time.
* **Security purpose**: Involves opening a device's casing, connecting a cable directly to diagnostic pins on the circuit board like UART, and using tools to read raw data or drop into a root command line without a network connection or password.

### TMUX

Terminal multiplexers, like `tmux` or `Screen`, are great utilities for expanding a standard Linux terminal's features, like having multiple windows within one terminal and jumping between them.

### VIM

Vim is a great text editor that can be used for writing code or editing text files on Linux systems.

{% embed url="https://vimsheet.com/" %}

## Service enumeration

### Nmap

Nmap is used to scan ports and let us know the services that are running.

Basic Nmap scan. This checks the 1,000 most common ports and runs a TCP scan by default:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

```bash
nmap <TARGET_IP>
```

We can use the `-sC` parameter to specify that `Nmap` scripts should be used to try and obtain more detailed information. The `-sV` parameter instructs `Nmap` to perform a version scan. In this scan, Nmap will fingerprint services on the target system and identify the service protocol, application name, and version. The version scan is underpinned by a comprehensive database of over 1,000 service signatures. Finally, `-p-` tells Nmap that we want to scan all 65,535 TCP ports.

<br>

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

```bash
nmap -sV -sC -p- <TARGET_IP>
```

* `-sV` → version detection
* `-sC` → run default scripts
* `-p-` → scan all 65,535 ports

### Nmap scripts

Specifying `-sC` will run many useful default scripts against a target, but there are cases when running a specific script is required.

```bash
nmap --script <SCRIPT_NAME> <TARGET_IP>
nmap --script ftp-anon <TARGET_IP>          # check anonymous FTP
```

```bash
nmap --script vuln <TARGET_IP>              # check known vulns
nmap --script ftp-anon <TARGET_IP>          # anonymous FTP check
nmap --script http-enum <TARGET_IP>         # web enumeration
nmap --script smb-vuln-ms17-010 <TARGET_IP> # EternalBlue check
```

## Attacking Network Services

### Banner grabbing

**Fingerprinting** = identifying exactly what is running on a target.

Like a human fingerprint — unique to each person. Every service leaves identifying information.

**Banner grabbing is one way to fingerprint:**

```bash
# Using Nmap
nmap -sV --script=banner <TARGET_IP>

# Using Netcat manually
nc -nv <TARGET_IP> 21

# Response:
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)
→ FTP server, version 3.0.3
```

Generic info → "FTP is running"\
Fingerprinted → "vsFTPd 3.0.3 is running"

Generic → can't find specific exploits\
Fingerprinted → Google "vsFTPd 3.0.3 CVE"\
→ find backdoor vulnerability\
→ exploit it

### FTP

`Nmap` scan of the default port for FTP (21) reveals the vsftpd 3.0.3 installation that we identified previously. Further, it also reports that anonymous authentication is enabled and that a `pub` directory is available.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### SMB

SMB (Server Message Block) is a prevalent protocol on Windows machines that provides many vectors for vertical and lateral movement. `Nmap` has many scripts for enumerating SMB, such as [smb-os-discovery.nse](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-os-discovery.html), which will interact with the SMB service to extract the reported operating system version.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

```bash
nmap -A -p<TARGET_PORT> <TARGET_IP>
```

This is an aggressive scan.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Why This Matters in Pentesting

The text is demonstrating the progression of enumeration. You start by finding an open port (`445`), then you use specialized tools (NSE scripts or `-A` flags) to pull the banners and exact software versions. Once you have those precise versions (e.g., _Windows 7 SP1_ or _Samba 4.6.2_), you can cross-reference them against public vulnerability databases to find specific, actionable exploits like EternalBlue.<br>

### Shares

* **SMB (Server Message Block)**: Protocol used to share folders and files remotely.
* **Security risk**: Shares frequently expose sensitive data like hardcoded passwords.
* **Tool (`smbclient`)**: Used to enumerate and interact with SMB shares from the command line.
  * `-L` lists all available shares on the target host.
  * `-N` suppresses the password prompt and forces an anonymous connection attempt.

Listing available shares:

```bash
smbclient -N -L \\\\<TARGET_IP>
```

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After finding a non-default share like `users`, we attempt to connect to it.

```bash
smbclient \\\\<TARGET_IP>\\<SHARE_NAME>
```

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If this fails, we need to find valid credentials elsewhere and then try again.

```bash
smbclient -U <USERNAME> \\\\<TARGET_IP>\\<SHARE_NAME>
```

After this, the tool asks for a password. Once inside the `smb: \>` prompt, it functions similarly to a basic FTP or Linux shell.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We can now use the `get` command to download the `passwords.txt` file.

### SNMP

* **SNMP (ports 161/162 TCP/UDP)**: Used for device management.
* **Versions 1 and 2c**: Insecure. They rely on unencrypted plaintext community strings instead of passwords.
* **Default danger**: Default strings are almost always `public` for read or `private` for write.
* **Pentest value**: Leaks running processes, internal routing tables, and exact software versions.

#### `snmpwalk`

```bash
snmpwalk -v 2c -c public <TARGET_IP> 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0
```

* `snmpwalk`: A tool that sends sequential requests to "walk" through a device's management data tree.
* `-v 2c`: Specifies that it is using SNMP version 2c (the insecure, plaintext version).
* `-c public`: Supplies `public` as the community string (password).
* `<TARGET_IP>`: The target IP address.
* `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0`: This OID points directly to the system's hostname.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If the community string fails, use `onesixtyone` to brute-force it.

```bash
onesixtyone -c dict.txt <TARGET_IP>
```

* `onesixtyone`: A highly efficient, multi-threaded scanner built specifically to brute-force SNMP community strings.
* `-c dict.txt`: Passes a text file containing a dictionary of common community strings (e.g., `public`, `private`, `internal`, `manager`, `cisco`).

## Web Enumeration

Use this section for first-pass web checks and fast follow-up.

Start with the [WF-Web Enumeration](wf-web-enumeration/) flow.

### Gobuster

GoBuster is a versatile tool that allows for performing DNS, vhost, and directory brute-forcing.

The tool has additional functionality, such as enumeration of public AWS S3 buckets.

#### Directory enumeration

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.121/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
```

What it does:

* Takes every word from the wordlist.
* Tries `http://IP/word` for each one.
* Reports which ones exist with `200`, `301`, or `403`.

Example finding:

* Found `/wordpress` with `301`.
* WordPress is installed.
* WordPress often has a large attack surface.

#### DNS subdomain enumeration

```bash
gobuster dns -d inlanefreight.com -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt
```

What it does:

* Tries `blog.domain.com`, `admin.domain.com`, and similar names.
* Reports which subdomains actually exist.

Why it matters:

* admin panels on subdomains
* dev or staging environments
* hidden applications

Related cheat sheet:

* [Gobuster](../../cheat-sheets/gobuster.md)

### cURL - Web Server Headers

```bash
curl -IL https://www.inlanefreight.com
```

What it reveals:

* `Server: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)` and other version details
* technology stack hints
* authentication methods
* security misconfigurations

Flag reminder:

* `-I` requests headers only.
* `-L` follows redirects.

* [cURL](../../cheat-sheets/curl.md)

### WhatWeb - Technology Fingerprinting

```bash
whatweb 10.10.10.121
whatweb --no-errors 10.10.10.0/24
```

What it reveals:

* web server such as Apache, Nginx, or IIS
* version numbers
* frameworks such as WordPress, PHP, or jQuery
* email addresses
* country data

Subnet use:

* Scan a whole `/24`.
* Find all web servers on the network at once.

Related cheat sheet:

* [WhatWeb](../../cheat-sheets/whatweb.md)

### SSL/TLS Certificates

Browse to `https://IP`.

Then click the padlock and view the certificate.

What it reveals:

* company name
* email addresses
* domain names
* phishing targets if that is in scope

Related cheat sheet:

* [SSL/TLS certificates](../../cheat-sheets/ssl-tls-certificates.md)

### robots.txt

Browse to `http://IP/robots.txt`.

What it reveals:

* paths search engines cannot index
* hidden admin pages
* private directories
* sensitive files

Example find:

```
Disallow: /private
```

Then browse to `/private`.

That may lead to an admin login page.

Related cheat sheet:

* [robots.txt](../../cheat-sheets/robots.txt.md)

### Page Source Code

Press `Ctrl+U` in the browser.

What to look for:

* developer comments with credentials
* hidden form fields
* hardcoded API keys
* internal IP addresses
* file paths that reveal server structure

Related cheat sheet:

* [Page source code](../../cheat-sheets/page-source-code.md)

### HTTP Status codes

* `200` — exists and is accessible
* `301` — redirect and still exists
* `302` — temporary redirect
* `401` — requires authentication
* `403` — exists but is forbidden
* `404` — does not exist
* `500` — server error

Related cheat sheet:

* [HTTP status codes](../../cheat-sheets/http-status-codes.md)

{% hint style="success" %}
### Key insight

WordPress found at `/IP/wordpress`

* WordPress is in setup mode.
* You may be able to configure it yourself.
* That can lead to remote code execution.
* One Gobuster result can lead to full server compromise.
{% endhint %}

## Public Exploits

After service fingerprinting, the next goal is to find public exploits that match the exact version.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Searchsploit tip:** Use `-m` to copy an exploit into your current directory.

```bash
searchsploit -m linux/remote/45233.py
```

### Searchsploit

Installation:

```
sudo dnf install exploitdb -y
```

Usage:

```
searchsploit openssh 7.2
```

We can also utilize online exploit databases to search for vulnerabilities, like [Exploit DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/), [Rapid7 DB](https://www.rapid7.com/db/), or [Vulnerability Lab](https://www.vulnerability-lab.com/).

#### Searchsploit technical flow

Use Searchsploit after service fingerprinting.

Start with a broad search.

Then narrow to the exact version.

```bash
nmap -sV -sC -p- <TARGET_IP>
searchsploit <SERVICE> <VERSION>
searchsploit -x <EDB_PATH>
searchsploit -m <EDB_PATH>
```

Useful flags:

* `-t` shows titles only.
* `-x` opens the exploit file for review.
* `-m` copies the exploit into the current directory.
* `--nmap scan.xml` maps an Nmap XML file to known exploits.

Related cheat sheet:

* [Searchsploit](../../cheat-sheets/searchsploit.md)

### Metasploit Primer

The Metasploit Framework is a core tool for pentesters.

It packages many public exploits and makes them easier to run against vulnerable targets.

* Reconnaissance & Enumeration: Includes auxiliary modules to scan ports, identify services, and discover active hosts.
* Vulnerability Verification: Offers `check` functions to safely confirm if a target is vulnerable without exploiting it.
* Advanced Payloads (Meterpreter): Provides an in-memory, highly stealthy runtime environment to run commands, inject processes, and manage sessions on a compromised target.
* Post-Exploitation & Pivoting: Features tools to harvest credentials, elevate privileges, and route traffic through a compromised machine to internal networks.

When configuring an exploit module (like `ms17_010_psexec` used in the text), two variables are almost universally required to route and establish the exploit payload successfully:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Why checking matters:** Firing an exploit blindly can crash remote legacy services (like SMB or RDP), trigger Blue Screens of Death (BSOD) on production systems, or unnecessarily trip Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).
{% endhint %}

The `check` command uses low-risk queries or auxiliary scanners to identify OS versions and service responses, validating the vulnerability before any intrusive payload code is actually executed.

#### Metasploit technical flow

Use Metasploit after you identify the service and version.

Search for a matching module.

Review the options before you run anything.

```bash
msfconsole
search <SERVICE> <VERSION>
use <MODULE>
show options
show payloads
set RHOSTS <TARGET_IP>
set LHOST <YOUR_IP>
check
run
```

Common post-run commands:

```bash
sessions
sessions -i <ID>
background
info
```

* [Metasploit](../../cheat-sheets/metasploit.md)

#### For practicing MSF

* Windows Targets (Great for SMB/IIS practice): _Blue_, _Legacy_, _Granny_, _Grandpa_, _Jerry_, _Optimum_, _Devel_.
* Linux Targets (Great for legacy network services): _Lame_.

## Types of shells

Use shell workflows after you get code execution.

They turn one exploit path into usable access.

### Shell workflows

* [WF-Reverse Shell](exploitation/wf-reverse-shell.md)
* [WF-Bind Shell](exploitation/wf-bind-shell.md)
* [WF-Web Shell](exploitation/wf-web-shell.md)

### Access paths

After compromise, you usually keep access in one of two ways:

1. **Legitimate remote access protocols**
2. **Interactive shells**

#### Legitimate remote access protocols

Use these when you recover valid credentials.

Common options:

* `SSH`
* `WinRM`

#### Interactive shells

Use these when you need command execution without stable remote login access.

A payload usually hooks into `/bin/bash`, `cmd.exe`, or `powershell.exe`.

### Main shell types

| Shell type        | How it works                                           | Best use                                            | Main limitation                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Reverse shell** | The target connects back to your listener.             | Best default choice during exploitation.            | Needs outbound access from the target.      |
| **Bind shell**    | The target opens a port and waits for your connection. | Useful when the target can expose a reachable port. | Inbound firewall rules often block it.      |
| **Web shell**     | A script runs commands through HTTP or HTTPS.          | Useful on web servers after file upload or RCE.     | Usually less interactive than a full shell. |

#### Reverse shell

The target connects back to your listener.

Use it when outbound traffic from the target works.

Start with [WF-Reverse Shell](exploitation/wf-reverse-shell.md).

#### Bind shell

The target exposes a listening port.

You connect directly to that port.

Start with [WF-Bind Shell](exploitation/wf-bind-shell.md).

#### Web shell

A web shell runs commands through HTTP or HTTPS.

Use it after file upload, write access to the webroot, or web-based RCE.

Start with [WF-Web Shell](exploitation/wf-web-shell.md).

### Shell stabilization

Basic shells often lack job control and terminal features.

Upgrade them early.

Common fixes:

* spawn a PTY with `python3`
* set `TERM=xterm`
* set terminal `rows` and `columns`

Use [WF-Reverse Shell](exploitation/wf-reverse-shell.md) for the full upgrade flow.
