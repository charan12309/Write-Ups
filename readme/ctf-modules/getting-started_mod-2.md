### Common Terms :

#### Shell :

The shell is a program that takes the input from the user and passes these commands to OS (Operating System) to perform a specific function.

#### Port:

Ports are virtual points where network connections begin and end.

They allow a computer to route different types of traffic simultaneously over a single network connection by mapping specific data streams to distinct software processes (e.g., SSH vs. web requests).

#### Web Server :

Software running on a host machine that directly handles HTTP/HTTPS traffic from a client browser over TCP ports 80 and 443.

It processes incoming requests, maps them to physical files, or hands them off to the application backend and it has a huge attack surface.

### Common Tools:

#### Using SSH:

Secure Shell is a network protocol that runs on port 22 by default and provides users a secure way to access a computer remotely.

SSH can be configured with password authentication or passwordless using public-key authentication using public/private key-pair.

#### Using Netcat:

Netcat, ncat or nc is used to interact with TCP/UDP Ports.

It can be used for many things during a pentest.

Its primary usage is for connecting to shells.

Netcat can be used to connect to any listening port and interact with the service on that port

Netcat can be used this way to obtain the banner running on that Port and IP.

This is called as Banner Grabbing.

Netcat can also be used to transfer files.

```
nc -nv <Target_IP> <Target_Port>
```

Then there is also Socat which is called as Netcat on steriods.A [standalone binary](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries) of `Socat` can be transferred to a system after obtaining remote code execution to get a more stable reverse shell connection.

Socat also supports forwarding ports and connecting to serial devices.

1. Port Forwarding :

When you hack a target network, you often find a central server (like a database) that is completely hidden from the internet behind a firewall.

You cannot talk to it directly.

But if you have already compromised the public web server sitting right next to it, you can tell that web server: _"Take any traffic I send to you on Port X, and automatically forward it to the hidden database on Port Y."_

2. Connecting to Serial Devices :

* Serial Devices: Physical hardware components (like routers, IoT devices, or microchips) that transmit data sequentially, one bit at a time.
* Security Purpose: Involves physically opening a device's casing, connecting a cable directly to diagnostic pins on the circuit board (like UART), and using tools to read raw data or drop straight into a root command line without a network connection and password.
