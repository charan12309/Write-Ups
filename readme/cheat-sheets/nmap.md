# Nmap

Use this page as a complete quick reference for the Nmap workflow covered in **Network Enumeration with Nmap**.

Use it when you need host discovery, port scanning, service enumeration, NSE checks, output handling, performance tuning, and firewall-aware scan options in one place.

### Basic syntax

Nmap uses this format:

```bash
nmap <scan types> <options> <target>
```

Common scan types:

```bash
nmap --help

<SNIP>
SCAN TECHNIQUES:
  -sS/sT/sA/sW/sM: TCP SYN/Connect()/ACK/Window/Maimon scans
  -sU: UDP Scan
  -sN/sF/sX: TCP Null, FIN, and Xmas scans
  --scanflags <flags>: Customize TCP scan flags
  -sI <zombie host[:probeport]>: Idle scan
  -sY/sZ: SCTP INIT/COOKIE-ECHO scans
  -sO: IP protocol scan
  -b <FTP relay host>: FTP bounce scan
<SNIP>
```

With `-sS`:

* `SYN-ACK` means `open`
* `RST` means `closed`
* no response often means `filtered`

Example:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS localhost

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-11 22:50 UTC
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.000010s latency).
Not shown: 996 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
5432/tcp open  postgresql
5901/tcp open  vnc-1

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.18 seconds
```

### Host discovery

Start by finding which hosts are alive.

#### Scan a subnet

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -sn -oA tnet | grep for | cut -d" " -f5

10.129.2.4
10.129.2.10
10.129.2.11
10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
10.129.2.28
```

What it does:

* `10.129.2.0/24` targets the whole subnet
* `-sn` skips the port scan
* `-oA tnet` saves `tnet.nmap`, `tnet.gnmap`, and `tnet.xml`

{% hint style="info" %}
This works best when hosts answer ICMP or other discovery probes.
{% endhint %}

If standard discovery fails, try direct TCP probes against likely ports such as `80` or `445`.

#### Scan an IP list

```bash
cat hosts.lst

10.129.2.4
10.129.2.10
10.129.2.11
10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
10.129.2.28
```

```bash
sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet -iL hosts.lst | grep for | cut -d" " -f5

10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
```

Use this when the scope is predefined.

If some hosts do not appear, they may be blocking or ignoring the default discovery traffic.

#### Scan multiple IPs directly

```bash
sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet 10.129.2.18 10.129.2.19 10.129.2.20 | grep for | cut -d" " -f5

10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
```

If the IPs are consecutive, use a range:

```bash
sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet 10.129.2.18-20 | grep for | cut -d" " -f5

10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
```

#### Scan one host

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-14 23:59 CEST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.18
Host is up (0.087s latency).
MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.11 seconds
```

#### See why Nmap used ARP

On a local subnet, Nmap often prefers ARP over ICMP.

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 00:08 CEST
SENT (0.0074s) ARP who-has 10.129.2.18 tell 10.10.14.2
RCVD (0.0309s) ARP reply 10.129.2.18 is-at DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF
Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.18
Host is up (0.023s latency).
MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.05 seconds
```

Why this happens:

* hosts on the same local subnet must use ARP to resolve MAC addresses
* if the target answers ARP, Nmap already knows the host is alive
* there is no need for a separate ICMP probe

Why it matters:

* ARP-based discovery is very reliable on the local segment
* local firewalls do not usually stop ARP the way they stop ICMP
* results can change once traffic crosses a router
* ARP does not cross routers
* remote discovery falls back to ICMP or TCP-based probes

Flag breakdown:

* `--packet-trace` prints sent and received packets
* `-PE` uses ICMP echo requests for discovery

{% hint style="info" %}
On a local subnet, Nmap may still prefer ARP even when `-PE` is set.
{% endhint %}

#### Use `--reason`

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --reason

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 00:10 CEST
SENT (0.0074s) ARP who-has 10.129.2.18 tell 10.10.14.2
RCVD (0.0309s) ARP reply 10.129.2.18 is-at DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF
Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.18
Host is up, received arp-response (0.028s latency).
MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.03 seconds
```

Key line:

* `Host is up, received arp-response`

#### Force ICMP instead of ARP

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 00:12 CEST
SENT (0.0107s) ICMP [10.10.14.2 > 10.129.2.18 Echo request (type=8/code=0) id=13607 seq=0] IP [ttl=255 id=23541 iplen=28 ]
RCVD (0.0152s) ICMP [10.129.2.18 > 10.10.14.2 Echo reply (type=0/code=0) id=13607 seq=0] IP [ttl=128 id=40622 iplen=28 ]
Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.18
Host is up (0.086s latency).
MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.11 seconds
```

This proves the host answered ICMP instead of ARP.

#### Use TTL as a clue

Common starting points:

* `64` for many Linux and Unix systems
* `128` for many Windows systems
* `255` for some network devices

{% hint style="warning" %}
Treat TTL as a clue, not proof. Routing hops and host configuration can change it.
{% endhint %}

#### Alternate host discovery strategies

When firewalls drop ICMP, switch strategies:

* TCP SYN Ping with `-PS`
* TCP ACK Ping with `-PA`
* UDP Ping with `-PU`

Why they help:

* `-PS` can trigger a TCP response even when ICMP is blocked
* `-PA` can trigger a `RST` and prove the host is alive
* `-PU` can trigger ICMP `Port Unreachable`

For large scopes, run host discovery first and scan only the live hosts you confirm.

### Host and port scanning

Once the host is up, map its exposed services.

Focus on:

* open ports and protocols
* service names and versions
* banners and metadata
* operating system clues

Nmap reports six possible port states.

By default, Nmap scans the top `1000` TCP ports.

If you run as root, Nmap usually uses `-sS`.

Without raw socket privileges, Nmap falls back to `-sT`.

Common scope options:

* `-p 22,25,80,139,445`
* `-p 22-445`
* `--top-ports=10`
* `-p-`
* `-F`

{% hint style="info" %}
Use `-p-` when you do not want to miss high-numbered ports.
{% endhint %}

#### Trace a SYN scan

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 21 --packet-trace -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 15:39 CEST
SENT (0.0429s) TCP 10.10.14.2:63090 > 10.129.2.28:21 S ttl=56 id=57322 iplen=44  seq=1699105818 win=1024 <mss 1460>
RCVD (0.0573s) TCP 10.129.2.28:21 > 10.10.14.2:63090 RA ttl=64 id=0 iplen=40  seq=0 win=0
Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.28
Host is up (0.014s latency).

PORT   STATE  SERVICE
21/tcp closed ftp
MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF (Intel Corporate)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.07 seconds
```

Here, the target returns `RST,ACK`.

That means the port is reachable but closed.

#### Use a TCP connect scan

The connect scan with `-sT` completes the full handshake.

It is accurate, but noisy.

If the target returns:

* `SYN-ACK`, the port is `open`
* `RST`, the port is `closed`

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 443 --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping -Pn -n --reason -sT

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 16:26 CET
CONN (0.0385s) TCP localhost > 10.129.2.28:443 => Operation now in progress
CONN (0.0396s) TCP localhost > 10.129.2.28:443 => Connected
Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.28
Host is up, received user-set (0.013s latency).

PORT    STATE SERVICE REASON
443/tcp open  https   syn-ack

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.04 seconds
```

#### Understand filtered TCP ports

Two common cases:

* dropped packets
* rejected packets

**Dropped packets**

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 139 --packet-trace -n --disable-arp-ping -Pn

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 15:45 CEST

139/tcp filtered netbios-ssn
MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF (Intel Corporate)

```

Key flags:

* `-p 139`
* `--packet-trace`
* `-n`
* `--disable-arp-ping`
* `-Pn`

**Rejected packets**

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 445 --packet-trace -n --disable-arp-ping -Pn

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 15:55 CEST
SENT (0.0388s) TCP 10.129.2.28:52472 > 10.129.2.28:445 S ttl=49 id=21763 iplen=44  seq=1418633433 win=1024 <mss 1460>
RCVD (0.0487s) ICMP [10.129.2.28 > 10.129.2.28 Port 445 unreachable (type=3/code=3) ] IP [ttl=64 id=20998 iplen=72 ]
Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.28
Host is up (0.0099s latency).

PORT    STATE    SERVICE
445/tcp filtered microsoft-ds
MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF (Intel Corporate)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.05 seconds
```

An ICMP `type 3 code 3` response is a strong firewall clue when the host is already known to be alive.

#### Discover open UDP ports

UDP scanning uses `-sU`.

It is slower because UDP has no handshake.

Many services do not reply to empty probes.

That means Nmap often waits for timeouts.

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -F -sU

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 16:01 CEST

MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF (Intel Corporate)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 98.07 seconds
```

Key flags:

* `-F` scans the top `100` ports
* `-sU` runs a UDP scan

{% hint style="warning" %}
UDP scans are often slow. Start small unless you have a reason to go broad.
{% endhint %}

#### Convert XML to HTML

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ xsltproc target.xml -o target.html
```

### Service enumeration

Use service enumeration to confirm what is actually running on a port.

It gives you:

* product names
* version numbers
* hostnames and OS clues
* better exploit search terms

#### Scan all TCP ports with version detection

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -sV

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 19:44 CEST

Stats: 0:00:03 elapsed; 0 hosts completed (1 up), 1 undergoing SYN Stealth Scan
SYN Stealth Scan Timing: About 3.64% done; ETC: 19:45 (0:00:53 remaining)
```

What it does:

* `10.129.2.28` targets the host
* `-p-` scans all TCP ports
* `-sV` runs service version detection

{% hint style="info" %}
Press the space bar during a running scan to print progress without stopping it.
{% endhint %}

Nmap mainly identifies services from banners.

If banners are incomplete, it falls back to signature matching.

#### Trace version detection

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -sV -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace

### NSE

NSE stands for **Nmap Scripting Engine**.

Use it when a basic port scan is not enough.

It helps you:

* grab banners and metadata
* enumerate service features
* run targeted checks by category
* spot likely vulnerabilities faster

{% hint style="warning" %}
Categories like `intrusive`, `exploit`, `brute`, `dos`, and some `vuln` checks can be noisy or risky. Use them only when scope allows it.
{% endhint %}

#### NSE categories

* `auth` — authentication and credential behavior
* `broadcast` — host discovery by broadcast
* `brute` — credential brute force
* `default` — the safe default set behind `-sC`
* `discovery` — host and service information gathering
* `dos` — denial-of-service testing
* `exploit` — known exploit paths
* `external` — external-service processing
* `fuzzer` — unusual input testing
* `intrusive` — checks that may affect the target
* `malware` — malware indicators
* `safe` — lower-risk checks
* `version` — deeper version detection
* `vuln` — known vulnerability checks

#### Run NSE

Run default scripts:

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap <target> -sC
```

Run a category:

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap <target> --script <category>
```

Run specific scripts:

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap <target> --script <script-name>,<script-name>
```

#### Example — banner and SMTP commands

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 25 --script banner,smtp-commands

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-16 23:21 CEST

```

What you learn:

* `banner` reveals `Postfix` and the `Ubuntu` clue
* `smtp-commands` shows supported SMTP commands
* supported commands can help with user enumeration paths

#### Use aggressive mode carefully

`-A` combines:

* `-sV`

<SNIP>
```

What you learn:

* likely WordPress paths and version clues
* usernames such as `admin`
* possible CVEs tied to the detected service

### Performance tuning

Tune performance when:

* the target range is large
* bandwidth is limited
* latency is high
* you need faster feedback

Useful controls:

* `-T <0-5>`
* `--max-retries`
* `--initial-rtt-timeout`
* `--max-rtt-timeout`
* `--min-rate`

{% hint style="warning" %}
Faster scans are not always better. Aggressive tuning can miss hosts, ports, or version data.
{% endhint %}

#### Tune RTT timeouts

Default:

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F

<SNIP>
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (10 hosts up) scanned in 39.44 seconds
```

Reduced RTT values:

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F --initial-rtt-timeout 50ms --max-rtt-timeout 100ms

<SNIP>
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (8 hosts up) scanned in 12.29 seconds
```

What to notice:

* the scan finishes much faster
* two hosts are missed
* short RTT values can hide slower systems

#### Reduce max retries

Default:

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F | grep "/tcp" | wc -l

23
```

Retry limit `0`:

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F --max-retries 0 | grep "/tcp" | wc -l

21
```

What to notice:

* the scan is faster
* two open ports are missed here
* low retries fit stable, low-loss networks best

#### Increase packet rate

Default:

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F -oN tnet.default

<SNIP>
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (10 hosts up) scanned in 29.83 seconds
```

Higher minimum rate:

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F -oN tnet.minrate300 --min-rate 300

<SNIP>
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (10 hosts up) scanned in 8.67 seconds
```

Compare counts:

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ cat tnet.default | grep "/tcp" | wc -l

23
```

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ cat tnet.minrate300 | grep "/tcp" | wc -l

23
```

What to notice:

* the faster scan still finds the same open ports
* `--min-rate` can speed things up without losing coverage
* it works best on stable networks that are not rate-limiting you

#### Use timing templates

Templates:

* `-T 0` or `-T paranoid`
* `-T 1` or `-T sneaky`
* `-T 2` or `-T polite`
* `-T 3` or `-T normal`
* `-T 4` or `-T aggressive`
* `-T 5` or `-T insane`

`-T 3` is the default.

Higher values push speed harder and increase noise.

Default timing:

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F -oN tnet.default

<SNIP>
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (10 hosts up) scanned in 32.44 seconds
```

`-T 5` timing:

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F -oN tnet.T5 -T 5

<SNIP>
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (10 hosts up) scanned in 18.07 seconds
```

Compare counts:

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ cat tnet.default | grep "/tcp" | wc -l

23
```

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ cat tnet.T5 | grep "/tcp" | wc -l

23
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Start with `-T 3` or `-T 4` unless you have a strong reason to go faster. Use `-T 5` carefully.
{% endhint %}

Fast decision rules:

* If the network is slow, tune RTT before pushing rate.
* If packets drop often, avoid very low retries.
* If you are whitelisted, `--min-rate` can save time quickly.
* If you need a simple speed boost, try `-T 4` first.

### Firewall and IDS/IPS evasion

Use these options when normal scans return `filtered` or hit monitoring controls.

#### Determine firewall behavior

Filtered traffic is usually:

* dropped
* rejected

Common ICMP errors:

* `Net Unreachable`
* `Net Prohibited`
* `Host Unreachable`
* `Host Prohibited`
* `Port Unreachable`
* `Proto Unreachable`

#### Compare SYN and ACK scans

SYN scan:

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 21,22,25 -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace
```

ACK scan:

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 21,22,25 -sA -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace
```

Use `-sA` when you want to test whether a firewall is filtering traffic rather than prove a port is open.

#### Detect IDS and IPS

Useful clues:

* aggressive scans against one service may trigger an operator response
* one `VPS` IP getting blocked suggests active controls
* switching to another `VPS` can confirm the behavior

#### Use decoys

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -D RND:5
```

Use `-D RND:5` to add five random decoys.

Decoys must be alive.

Spoofed packets are often filtered by ISPs and routers.

#### Test a different source IP

Test the rule:

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -n -Pn -p445 -O
```

Use a different source:

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -n -Pn -p 445 -O -S 10.129.2.200 -e tun0
```

Useful flags:

* `-O`
* `-S`
* `-e tun0`

#### Use DNS servers and source port `53`

Useful options:

* `--dns-server <ns>,<ns>`
* `--source-port 53`

Filtered port:

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p50000 -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace
```

Same scan from source port `53`:

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p50000 -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace --source-port 53
```

Test the access with `ncat`:

```bash
impale7@htb[/htb]$ ncat -nv --source-port 53 10.129.2.28 50000

Ncat: Version 7.80 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Connected to 10.129.2.28:50000.
220 ProFTPd
```
